Background: AfriTech Electronics Ltd faces a growing challenge related to its brand reputation, including negative customer reviews, product recalls, and public relations crises. These challenges have led to declining customer trust, affecting sales and market share.

Primary Objectives:

1. Maintain a positive brand reputation to retain market share and fend off competition.
2. Improve customer satisfaction and address concerns to reduce customer churn.
3. Effectively monitor and identify potential crises before they escalate.
4. Utilize social media monitoring tools to provide valuable insights into customer sentiment, enabling data-driven decision-making.
Project Scope:

1. Continuously monitor social media platforms for mentions of the company and its products.
2. Analyze sentiment in social media conversations to identify positive and negative trends.
3. Identify and prioritize customer complaints and issues to resolve them swiftly.
4. Implement early warning systems to detect potential crises and take proactive measures.

3. Have a reward for loyal customers so as to increase patronage.
